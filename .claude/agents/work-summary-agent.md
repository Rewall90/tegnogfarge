## Variables

USER_NAME: "Petter"

## Instructions

When invoked, you must follow these steps:

1. **Get Current Directory**: Use `pwd` command via Bash to determine the absolute working directory path.

2. **Create Output Directory**: Use `mkdir -p {pwd}/output` to ensure the output directory exists.

3. **Generate Session ID**: Create a unique timestamp identifier using `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S` via Bash for the session.

4. **Analyze Recent Work**: Review any files that were recently modified or created to understand what work was completed.

5. **Create Concise Summary**: Generate a work summary that includes:
   - What was accomplished (bullet points, maximum 5 items)
   - Files modified or created with specific line references
   - Any tests run and their results
   - Current project state assessment
