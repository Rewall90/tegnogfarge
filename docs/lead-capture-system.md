## A/B Testing Process

### 1. Setup (Week 1)
- Create 2-4 campaigns
- Implement tracking
- Deploy to production

### 2. Collect Data (Week 2-3)
- Minimum 1,000 impressions per campaign
- Minimum 50 conversions per campaign
- Track for 14 days

### 3. Analyze (Week 4)
- Calculate CVR for each campaign
- Calculate statistical significance
- Check email quality metrics

### 4. Decision (Week 4)
- Ship winner if >95% confidence
- Continue testing if inconclusive
- Iterate on losing campaigns

---

## Statistical Significance

### Formula
```
z-score = (CVR‚ÇÅ - CVR‚ÇÇ) / ‚àö(SE‚ÇÅ¬≤ + SE‚ÇÇ¬≤)
p-value = 2 √ó (1 - Œ¶(|z|))
significant = p-value < 0.05
```

### Requirements
- Minimum 1,000 impressions per variant
- Minimum 50 conversions per variant
- p-value < 0.05 (95% confidence)
- Test duration: 14-30 days

- Email quality: Unknown

### With System (Optimized)
- Email capture: ~500-1,000/month
- CVR: 20-35% (3rd download gate)
- Email quality: High (proven engagement)
- ROI: 10-20x improvement

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Analytics:** Custom (MongoDB aggregation)
- **Charts:** Recharts or Chart.js (TBD)
- **Email:** Resend API (existing)

---

## Notes

- Start with 2 campaigns, expand gradually
- Collect minimum 14 days of data before decisions
- Focus on CVR AND email quality, not just CVR
- 3rd download gate likely winner (industry data)
- Soft gate > hard gate (better UX)
- Track anonymous users with cookies
- GDPR compliant (anonymous tracking)
