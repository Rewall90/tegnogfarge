# Zoom & Pan Function – Feature Specification

## Objective

Implement a dedicated **Zoom & Pan mode** for the canvas within the coloring application. This feature is intended to improve user navigation on the canvas while maintaining accuracy in all drawing interactions.

---

## Goals

- Allow users to **zoom in and out** and **pan** across the canvas area.
- Prevent unintended interactions with drawing tools while in zoom mode.
- Preserve zoom/pan state when exiting zoom mode.
- Ensure **accurate coordinate tracking** after zoom and pan.

---

## Feature Description

### 1. Toggle Button (Zoom Mode)

- A toggle button enables or disables Zoom & Pan mode.
- When enabled:
  - The user can zoom (e.g. pinch or scroll) and pan (drag) freely on the canvas.
  - **All other tools** (brush, flood fill, etc.) are disabled.
  - Only navigation is possible.
- When disabled:
  - All drawing tools become available again.
  - The current zoom and pan state is **preserved**.

### 2. Canvas State Preservation

- When exiting zoom mode:
  - The canvas must **retain** its current zoom level and position.
  - There should be **no reset** or repositioning.
  - This ensures a seamless transition back to drawing mode.

### 3. Coordinate Precision (Critical)

- During zoom and pan, the app must **maintain precise control of pointer coordinates**.
- All interactions (click, tap, drag) should map **accurately** to the canvas regardless of zoom level or pan offset.
- This is crucial for:
  - **Flood Fill**: The fill must occur at the correct location.
  - **Brush/Pencil Tools**: Drawing must align exactly with the user's pointer or finger.

## Summary of Requirements

| Feature                 | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zoom Toggle            | Enable/disable canvas zooming and panning                                   |
| Navigation-Only Mode   | Disable drawing while zoom mode is active                                   |
| State Persistence      | Preserve zoom/pan state when zoom mode is turned off                        |
| Accurate Coordinates   | Ensure all pointer-based actions behave correctly under transformed canvas  |

---

## Notes

- This feature should **only affect the canvas element** – UI and surrounding components should not zoom.
- Implementation should be compatible with **both desktop and mobile interactions**.
